## Statistics Language
This project is my attempt at a statistical programming language. Currently, in terms of statistics, it only supports:

-creating a series

-taking the mean of a series

-taking the sum of a series

-taking the variance of a series

-reading in a csv file as a dataframe*

-performing linear regression with a dataframe


*It should be noted, however, that dataframe's in their current form only support data that is numeric and the data must not contain any quotes.

The language itself, absent statistics, is largely just the Lox programming language as presented in: http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html with modifications to syntax. 


## Usage
If you would like to test the language in it's current form, just clone this repo and import the project into the IDE of your choice and run Lox.java which starts the REPL.


Please see exampleCode.txt for code examples.
